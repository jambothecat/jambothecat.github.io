# Music Around The World 
Final project for CIS 3755.

This website shows two visualizations that document where artists from the Billboard Global Top 200 charts are from. There's not much to set up honestly since you may view everything at https://jambothecat.github.io, but if you do want to see the backend of everything or maybe use the CSV files yourself you can simply download the ZIP file and unzip it. Some lessons that I personally have learned is definitely GitHub pages. I had no idea this was a thing before this project. Another thing would definitely be the art of scrollytelling in general. It's fun setting up something so interactive, and I definitely plan on expanding on this or even refining it so that the data and visualizations are more accurate!
